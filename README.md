# Missing-Person-Identification-System-using-CCTV
In this software where we will find a person with the help of face recognition software. In this software we can also find missing people, terrorists etc. This software has its own backup information for the missing person. As soon as someone is identified by the software they will send a warning message to the nearest station.

Algorithms used: 

HAAR CASCADE Algorithm: - HAAR CASCADE
is a machine learning algorithm used to identify
objects in pictures or video. It is a machine-based
learning method where cascade activity is trained
from many beautiful and beautiful pictures and
videos. Used for finding items in other photos and
videos
The algorithm has four stages:
● Haar Feature Selection
● Creating Integral Images
● Adaboost Training • Cascading Classifiers
● It is well known for being able to detect
faces and body parts in an image, but can be
trained to identify almost any object.

Experimental setting :
1. This project is implemented using C# in .NET
framework.
2. We have use Visual Studio which is is an
integrated development environment from
Microsoft.
3. In addition, our system requires less software
and hardware compared to existing systems.
4. In testing period we have taken around 100-200
images of type: JPG, PNG, JPEG, BitMap etc
and tested our algorithm. The proposed method
achieved the highest performance of the tested
methods, with an average resolution of
97.01%,When the standard image size was set to
30X30, which is average image size, the
performance improved by an average resolution
of 37.1% compared with when the standard
image size was set to 5050, under the same
experimental conditions.

FUTURE SCOPE:
The purpose of researching the traditional way of
finding people is to perform a process that takes time
and requires a great deal of human effort. It also
requires moving from place to place to get help and
disseminate information. Information obtained about
a missing person may not always be accurate. Details
always require manual verification with the help of
this system based on Finding People's face
recognition. We will be able to reduce people's time
and locations. The future task we focus on now is to
implement and evaluate the performance of our
proposed system so that we can prove that our
proposed system is better at Finding a Lost Person
than any of the previous proposed programs.process
is done with real crime images on the web and gives
good results. We believe this program will reduce
crime in our area.
